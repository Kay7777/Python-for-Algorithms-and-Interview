1.Breath First Search(BFS):
    -BFS is one of the easiest algorithms for searching a graph!
    
    EX1:Pocket Rube 2X2X2
        vertex: for each possible state of cube  8!3^8
        edge: for each possible move
        finally 11 levels can sovle this
        
    -visit all the nodes reachable from given s
    -O(V+E) time
    -look at nodes reachable in O moves, 1 move, 2 move ...Adj[s]
    -caredful to avoid duplicates(go back)
