1.Introduction to Recursion
    The fisrt insrances of recursion is when recursion is used as a technique in which a funtion makes one ot more calls to itslef.
    The second instance of recursion is when a data structiure uses smaller instances of the exact same type of data strcture when it represents itself.
    
    Factrial Example:
    4! = 43! = 432! = 4321! if n=0,n!=1
    Whenever you are trying to develop a recursive solution it is very important to think about the base case as your solution will need to return 
    the base case once all the recursive cases have beem worked through.
    
    # Recursion Factorial example
    def facturial(n):
        if n==0:
            return 1
        return n * facturial(n-1)
    print(facturial(4))
    
    # detemine dose the list contains all the phrase words, if yes return the words in a list
    def word_split(phrase,listofwords,output = None):
        if output is None:
            output=[]
        for word in listofwords:
            if phrase.startwith(word):
                output.append(word)
                return word_split(phrase[len(word):], listofwords, output)
        return output
    print(word_split('themanran',['the','ran','man'])
