1. Stack Overview:
    A stack is an ordered collection of items there the addition of new items 
    and the removal of existing items alwasy takes place at the same end.
    This end is commonly referred to as the top
    The end opposite the top is known as the base
    The base of the stack is significant since items stored in that stack that are closer to the base represent 
    those that have been in the stack the longest
    ## The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removes firstly ##
    Newer items are near the top, older items are near the base!
    ## last add , first out! ##
    
2. stack()  to create a new srtack
    push() add a new
    pop()  return and delete the top item
    peek() return the top but not delete
    isEmpty() check is it empty
    size() return the num of it 
    # we alwasy use list as a stack
    
3. Queue Overview
    # A queue is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the rear and the removal of 
    existing items occurs at the other end, commonoy called the font!
    # As the element enters the queue it starts ar the rear and makes its way toward the fonr waiting until 
    that ime when it is the next elemtent to ve removed.
    ### First in First out!!! ###
    
4. Queue

    enqueue()  add a new item
        return self.items.insert(0,item)
    dequeue()   delete the oldest item
        return self.items.pop()
    isEmpty()   checke empoty or not
        return self.items == []
