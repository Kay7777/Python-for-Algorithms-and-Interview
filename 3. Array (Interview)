1. Theory Questions
    # Unfortunately, this is not the case with arrays, 
    # you will most likely find the interview problems not having nuch 
    # in common with the theory and execise leatures
    these interview problems will seem very challenging. 
    if fell stuck try writing out waht you would do manually to sovle the problem (brute-force).
    try solving these with pen/ paper oe a whiteboard first
    
2. First Interview question: Anagram Check!
    Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. 
    EX: 'public relations' is an anagram of 'crap built on lies'
    note: ignore spaces and capitalization.
    
    Code!:
    def check_anagram(a,b):
      a = a.replace(' ','').lower()
      b = b.replace(' ','').lower()
      return sorted(a)==sorted(b)
    print(check_anagram(a,b))
    
3. Second : Paired Sum
    Given an integer array, output all the unique pairs that sumuo to a speci=fic value k
    so the input [1,3,2,2],4  return(1,3),(2,2)
    Code!:
    alist=[1,3,2,2]
    k = 4
    def check_sum(arr,k):
        if len(arr) < 2:
            return
        # sets for tracking
        seen = set()
        output = set()
        for num in arr:
            target = k - num
            if target not in seen:
                seen.add(num)
            else:
                output.add(((min(num,target)), max(num,target) ))
        print('\n'.join(map(str,list(output))))

    check_sum(alist,k)
