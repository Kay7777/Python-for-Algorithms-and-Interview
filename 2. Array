1.basic computer architecture 
  all three main sequences: list, tuple, string can use indexing a[1] = 1.
2. Low-level computer architecture
  memory of a computer stored in bits
  typical unit is byte which is 8 bits 
  each byte associated with unique address
  computer's main memory performs as random access memory(RAM)
  individual byte of memoru can be stored in O(1) time
3.referential arrays
  a group of related variables can be stored one after another in a contiguous portion of the computer's memory
  we will denote such a representation as an array
  each cell of an array uses the same num of bytes
  allow any cell to be accessed in constan time
  memory address can be computed using the : start+ (cellsize)(index)
  each cell of the array neesd to have the same num of bytes
  aech element is a reference to the object
  deep copy and shallow copy
  EX: counters = [0] * 9 is not make each index point to one 0, but all nine cells reference the same object.
